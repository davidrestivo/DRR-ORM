# DRR-ORM

## Description
This program uses the javascript to use ORM methods build the back end for an e-commerce site. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. I setup a demonstration via Thunder Client to Query the databases, adding to, and deleting from for 3 different sections - Categories, Tags, Products.
